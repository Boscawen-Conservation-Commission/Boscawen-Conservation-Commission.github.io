<h5>What does Conservation Commission do?</h5>
<p>Boscawen's Conservation Commission cares about the environment and tries to make the Town of Boscawen a better place to live. We spend a lot of time outdoors. We manage the Town's forests. We hike and hunt in them too. We clean up the Walker Pond shore. We kayak on it when the water is soft and skate on it when the water is hard. It takes some work, but it's good work, and we meet a lot of good people along the way. There are opportunities to learn. There are opportunities to teach. Some of us have made a professional career in forestry or conservation. Some of us just do it for fun. We learn from each other. Everyone has something to contribute. Would you like to join us? If you live in Boscawen we'd love to have you. Please fill out the short application form found <a href="https://www.boscawennh.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif4166/f/uploads/fillable_application_for_appointment_to_board_committee_commission_3.pdf">here</a> and email it to <a href="mailto:keasler@boscawennh.gov">keasler@boscawennh.gov</a>. If you have any questions, concerns, or comments for the Commission you can send these along as well and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>What, more specifically, does the Commission do? Our major goals are outlined in Boscawen's Master Plan. In short, these include:
<ul>
  <li>To conserve Boscawen’s natural resources including water features, wetlands and forest.</li>
  <li>To preserve Boscawen’s appearance and rural character.</li>
  <li>To educate, engage, and support Boscawen’s residents with regard to conservation.</li>
  <li>To build professional relationships with communities and organizations in the region that align with our goals.</li>
  <li>To provide opportunities for recreational enjoyment of Boscawen’s natural resources by its residents. </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Conservation Commission meets monthly on the third Tuesday at 6:30 PM at the Town offices. We discuss ongoing and potential work we can undertake to further the conservation goals mentioned above. We meet with visitors who come to educate us or work on a joint project. We review applications for projects with potential environmental impact. We advise the Select Board, other boards and committees, and the public as needed. The public is welcome to attend our meetings. If you are unable to attend a meeting, but have a specific question for the Commission, please contact Kellee Jo Easler at <a href="mailto:keasler@boscawennh.gov">keasler@boscawennh.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of meetings the Commission does a variety of work. Forests don't take care of themselves in the 21st century, at least not in a way that is helpful for humans. Trails need trimming and cleaning and trailheads need updating. Ongoing forestry management takes place. Occasionally there are special <a href="projects.html">projects</a>. And we engage with other local and regional <a href="links.html">stakeholders</a> including NH Fish and Game and the snowmobile club as the situation warrants and time allows.</p>
