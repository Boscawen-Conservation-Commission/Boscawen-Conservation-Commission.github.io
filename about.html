<h5>What does Conservation Commission do?</h5>
<p>Boscawen's Conservation Commission is a group of volunteers engaging in environmental conservation efforts in the Town of Boscawen. Our major goals are outlined in Boscawen's Master Plan. In short, these include:
<ul>
  <li>To conserve Boscawen’s natural resources including water features, wetlands and forest.</li>
  <li>To preserve Boscawen’s appearance and rural character.</li>
  <li>To educate, engage, and support Boscawen’s residents with regard to conservation.</li>
  <li>To build professional relationships with communities and organizations in the region that align with our goals.</li>
  <li>To provide opportunities for recreational enjoyment of Boscawen’s natural resources by its residents. </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Conservation Commission meets monthly on the third Thursday at 6:30 PM at the Town offices. We discuss ongoing and potential work we can undertake to further the conservation goals mentioned above. We meet with visitors who come to educate us or work on a joint project. We review applications for projects with potential environmental impact. We advise the Select Board, other boards and committees, and the public as needed. The public is welcome to attend our meetings and residents are encouraged to join the Commission if they are interested in helping with any of the work we do. If you are unable to attend a meeting, but have a specific question for the Commission, please contact Kellee Jo Easler at keasler@boscawennh.gov</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining the Commission we'd love to have you! Please fill out the short application form found <a href="https://www.boscawennh.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif4166/f/uploads/fillable_application_for_appointment_to_board_committee_commission_3.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of meetings the Commission does a variety of work. Occasionally there are special projects to be completed that came up in meeting. We regularly monitor and maintain the Town Forests. We engage with other local and regional stakeholders including NH Fish and Game and the snowmobile club.</p>
