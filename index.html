<h5>Mar 19, 2024</h5>
<p>Here is a website that is functional and asthetically pleasing. We have full control of layout and content. It will help us stay more closely connected to our community. We can post maps. We can showcase our forests. We can showcase every project we do whether it is a new easement or a picnic table at Walker Pond. We can post as many photos as we want (limit of ~3000 photos on this particular web host). We can update this website anytime we want.</p>

<p>This particular demonstration is hosted at GitHub, the world's largest host of source code with over 420 million projects. Among other things, small websites can be hosted at GitHub for free. We could pay for web hosting, but I don't think we need that right now. <b>I advise that we continue to use GitHub as a host unless we outgrow it.</b>I am using my personal GitHub account for this demonstration. <b>I advise that an account be created for our organization, Boscawen Conservation Commission, so that if I get hit by a bus you all don't lose access to the website.</b></p>
<p>Anyone who wants to directly edit the website can create a free GitHub account and be given access to the website files. Anyone who wants to provide me with content, but does not want to code anything, can give me that content and some guidance on how you'd like to see it used and I can add it to the website.</p>
<p>I don't think every update to the website can or should go through a committee process, but if anyone is interested in helping run the website on a more than occasional basis <b>it might be worth creating a subcommittee for this purpose.</b> And finally, <b>I would advise that we purchase a domain name to make it more convenient for visitors to access the website.</b> A short, memorable name that is easy to say and easy to spell would be great. Perhaps boscawenconservation.com? bccnh.com? Domains can be registered for $10-20 per year.</p>
