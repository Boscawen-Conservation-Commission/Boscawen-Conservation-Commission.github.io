<p class="highlight">Hunting season is here! Hunters are welcome on town lands. Please <a href="explore.html#rules">read and understand the rules</a> regarding hunting on town land. For everyone's safety, anyone in the woods during hunting season should be wearing orange.</p>

<p class="highlight">Several turtle species are still active until October. Please look out for them, especially when driving near Boscawen's many wetland areas and waterways. Many turtle populations are in decline so it's important to protect what we have. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello and welcome! If you know where you're headed then the navigation bar at the top of the page is likely the quickest way there. Otherwise read on to see what resources are available on this website.</p>

<p>Boscawen's Conservation Commission is a group of volunteers working together to preserve the Town's natural resources and make these resources available to the community in a sustainable way. <a href="about.html">Click here</a> to learn more about the Commission or to contact us.</p>
  
<p>Our Town Forests include over 20 miles of hiking trails and access to Walker Pond, one of the least developed Great Ponds in New Hampshire. Maps, directions, and other information can be found <a href="explore.html">here.</a></p>

<p>Aside from the Town Forests the Commission is involved in a number of other projects in Town. The Morrill Easement is the largest of several easements and was purchased in a joint venture with the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. Timber harvests occasionally take place on Town land. These are done primarily to preserve the health of the forest, but are also a source of revenue. To learn about these and other projects, <a href="projects.html">look here.</a></p> 

<p>Under the heading of <a href="links.html">links</a> you will find a list of websites curated by Commission that includes partner organizations, other local conservation organizations, resources for further education, and other sites of particular interest.</p>
